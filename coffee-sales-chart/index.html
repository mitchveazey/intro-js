    <h3>Mitch Veazey | Spring 2019</h3>
    <h1>Coffee sales</h1>

    <h2>The focus of this assignment is to create two bar charts on the same web page that represent a static visualization.</h2>

        <h3>The dataset:</h3>
        <p>The bar charts show the total coffee sales for a chain of coffee shops.<br>The first bar chart shows the total sales per region (i.e. Central, West, East, South).<br>The second bar chart shows the total sales per product category (i.e. Coffee, Tea, Espresso, Herbal Tea).<br>Use the dataset coffee.csv to create both of these charts.<br><br>Notice that this dataset is not in the ideal form --  aggregate the data for the region and category data attributes and then compute the total sales.<br>Accomplish this with JavaScript code (the d3-nest function is a great place to start).<br>Do not use Excel, Python, etc. to create the aggregated dataset.</p>

        <h3>Features and functionality:</h3>
        <p>Creates 2 bar charts that show the required data from the instructions (1 chart for regional sales, 1 chart for sales by product category) – we will check to make sure the bar charts are data accurate.<br>Your code processes the raw data (all of the sales data rows) to create a data structure for the 2 charts – d3.nest() is a good place to look<br>JavaScript code processes the data<br>Labels and axes for both charts.<br></p>
